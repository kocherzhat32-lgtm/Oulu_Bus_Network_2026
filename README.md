# Oulu Bus Network 2026 — GTFS SQL Analysis

This project analyzes the Oulu public transport network using GTFS data and SQL.  
The goal is to understand route structure, stop usage, trip frequency, weekday service patterns, and overall network behavior.

This is a self‑initiated portfolio project created as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
